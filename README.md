Programming language called ADBIR (which in Urdu means nothing..), it is made by
two friends who had nothing else to do and decided to bond and work on a coding project together. The language compiles into Python, so do not expect this to be the most suitable programming language for intensive tasks, machine learning, or competitive programming. 




## Installation

In order to install this programming language, ensure you have the needed requirements. 

```bash
- Python 3.13.0 (or above)
- Py_to_exe (can be forked from git if needed)
```
